Title:
BlockBazaar - Double Deposit Escrow Smart Contracts for Decentralized E-Commerce


Abstract:
The online marketplace and escrow system stand to benefit tremendously from blockchain technology and decentralization. Such systems save transactors money, minimize privacy risks, and give users control over their transactions, rather than relying on often unreliable, restrictive, and expensive third-party platforms. For these reasons, we implement a decentralized, Ethereum-based escrow marketplace that provides a setting for untrusted parties to initiate transactions without authority-bearing third-party arbiters in order to maintain anonymity, transaction integrity, and transparency. With blockchain technology, we are able to leverage smart contracts and use Ether to ensure that both parties remain compliant with their agreement, while also minimizing many of the aforementioned risks and costs of traditional third-party platforms. By implementing smart contracts through the Remix IDE and deploying them to an Ethereum network, and with the use of cryptocurrency wallets such as MetaMask, we are able to run transactions anonymously and securely store them on the Ethereum blockchain. This protocol creates a strong monetary incentive for both parties to go ahead with their transaction, while also keeping their transaction private and secure. More specifically, our smart contract allows one seller to sell items to any quantity of buyers at once. Moreover, using Javascript,  HTML, and CSS, we designed and built a website that serves as the front end of our smart contract, so that users donâ€™t have to interact on Etherscan, which requires some knowledge of the programming language Solidity. Simply put, we are providing a layer of abstraction for all parties while also simplifying the process for them. Thus, the website can serve as a decentralized e-commerce application, where sellers and buyers can use their Metamask wallets  to perform secure and efficient commerce.
